Theriotype
---------------------

Welcome to my not-so-secret theriotype page! A theriotype is a representation of how I identify as someone who doesn't identify as human.

Not someone who spiritually identifies with non-humans in their past life, in the now.

Not a sona with a separate name and identity, but who I am.

Let's get to it!

* Faction: Non-aligned Indigenous Lifeform (aka Anarchist)
* My theriotype is a Pretender with a tank alt mode, and whose shell approximates my physical body. This makes sense due to me being fine with my fleshy body, a rare trait for therians.
* You might notice ey take some aspects from TFA Blitzwing if you pay attention!
* Representing my attachment to the Bumbler I own and who represents my healing, ey have a little companion Bumbler with the Bumblebag.
* The dots on eir chestplate represent the buttons I wear in real life.

I don't want representations of my Theriotype drawn without my consent and I don't want to set myself up as an avatar. That feels...a bit weird.
