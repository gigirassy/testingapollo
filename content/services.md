Blitzwing Services
------------------

These are services I host on subdomains of this site, through VPSes, and simple pages.

I had some misadventures beforehand, before I realized a VPS with Caddy and Docker would be easier. (and easier it was!)

Donations: In lieu of giving me money directly, consider contributing to [my wishlist](https://throne.com/gigirassy) so I can have more money left to pay for the services. It helps a ton as me and my family have virtually no income at the moment, and it's anonymous as well. Costs for my Hetzner-hosted services total to around 10 euro a month.

### Usage Policy

By using the services, you agree that you will not use them for exploitation of others, DDoS/memory flooding, data scraping (host your own instead!), purposes related to harmful structures (ick!), or commercial activities.

#### _Squawk!_

<span style="float:right;">![squawktalk](/squawktalk.png)</span> Squawktalk from Transformers, the [honorary canary](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/warrant-canary-faq), would like to inform you that my services have not been served a warrant, subpoena, or forced to do any modifications by law enforcement. Pay attention; if Squawktalk leaves, run.

### Services

### Not-Publicly Linked Services

*   Invidious: This is hosted on a different VPS than what I normally use, one that hasn't been blocked yet. To prevent people from abusing it to the point where the VPS is blocked, you'll have to email me for the link. nune\[.at.\]imap\[.dot.\]fi . Doesn't have to be formal, you can just put something like "Can I has Invidious" in the subject with a cute cat pic attached and I'll send it to you. Alias will not be replied to. I won't care about what you watch.

### Planned services

If it's not here, please don't inquire about it.

*   PrivateBin: One day, I'll get it figured out.
