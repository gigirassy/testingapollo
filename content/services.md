Blitzwing Services
------------------

These are services I host on subdomains of this site, through VPSes, and simple pages.

I had some misadventures beforehand, before I realized a VPS with Caddy and Docker would be easier. (and easier it was!)

### Usage Policy

By using the services, you agree that you will not use them for exploitation of others, DDoS/memory flooding, data scraping (host your own instead!), purposes related to harmful structures, harassment, immoral content, or commercial activities.

### Privacy
By design, I do not log your usage of the services at all. The only things I log related to them are anonymous analytics of visits to this page via Umami, which can not personally identify you and are used to benefit the services via checking if they're being served fairly.

For encrypted services, I don't even know what's in the paste/upload/etc. I can only respond to a takedown if you have the full URL.

For anything under frontends, takedown requests will be ignored as I have no control on what's on them. They're proxies.

#### _Squawk!_

<span style="float:right;">![squawktalk](/squawktalk.png)</span> Squawktalk from Transformers, the [honorary canary](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/warrant-canary-faq), would like to inform you that my services have not been served a warrant, subpoena, or forced to do any modifications by law enforcement. Pay attention; if Squawktalk leaves, run.

### Services

### Archiving!

*   [ArchiveBox](https://ab.blitzw.in): A personal instance for me to archive Transformers stuff.

#### Searching!

*   [SearXNG](https://search.blitzw.in/): A self-described "metasearch engine" that gathers results from many different search engines without tracking you.
*   [LibreY](https://libre.blitzw.in/): Another "metasearch engine" that gathers results from many different search engines without tracking you. Feel free to set either it or SearXNG as your default!
*   [Whoogle Search](https://wh.blitzw.in): Google frontend. Rate-limited too often.


#### Utility!
*   [Send](https://send.blitzw.in): Share files with handy links!
*   [Stirling PDF](https://pdf.blitzw.in): Helpful tools for your PDFs!
*   [IT Tools](https://tools.blitzw.in): Loads of helpful tools for developers, like decoding and encoding stuff, generating QR codes, and more.
*   [Privatebin](https://bin.blitzw.in): A private, encrypted Pastebin! Use it to share your love notes, code, and more.
*   [Cobalt](https://co.blitzw.in): Download files from many social media sites! Uses Cobalt 7 instead of 10. I have a petty grudge towards the developer for making it so in versions 10 amd up, only the API and not the UI is easily self-hostable. Why? They want you to use it at a centralized UI that uses a product by Cloudflare, which basically defeats the point of open-source privacy software. Nevertheless, I find version 7 helpful. **Under basic auth**. Username is blitzwing and password is cloudflarehater3000.
*   [Etherpad](https://eth.blitzw.in): A document editing thingy! **Keep in mind that this is not end-to-end encrypted.** Use Privatebin to share confidential info instead.
*   [Hat](https://hat.blitzw.in): Allows you to encrypt files and decrypt them!

#### Frontends!

*   [Mozhi](https://moz.blitzw.in): Another translation frontend that doesn't track you! Translate from and to many languages here.
*   [Breezewiki](https://fan.blitzw.in): Browse Fandom without being exposed to military ads and cringe comments made by 10-year-olds. (Including my own!)
*   [Wikimore](https://wikimore.blitzw.in): A frontend for WikiMedia projects.
*   [RedLib](https://rl.blitzw.in): Browse Reddit without being tracked! WebDock-hosted. **Under basic auth due to data scraping**. Username is blitzwing and password is redlib.
*   [SafeTwitch](https://twitch.blitzw.in): A Twitch frontend without tracking!
*   [Binternet](https://pin.blitzw.in): Browse the unhinged world of Pinterest without tracking!
*   [Quetre](https://q.blitzw.in): Browse bad opinions on Quetre without tracking!
*   [Rat Ain't Tieba](https://rat.blitzw.in): Chinese language frontend to Baidu Tieba that loads way faster, making it useful for when you'd like to browse it with translation.

I also run Snowflake proxies on both of my servers, with a capacity of 5 and a port range of 62950-63000. This allows people in censored countries to use parts of the internet at no cost or risk to me.

### Specs:

* IT Tools and hat.sh are hosted on Vercel at no cost to me.
* My file server, Binternet, Cobalt, RAT, and Etherpad instances run on a Webdock KVM VPS with minimal specs.
* Anything else uses a WebDock KVM Virtual Machine-based VPS, located in Denmark, with about 12GB of RAM, running on 4 threads and 80GB of space, costing $13.00 USD a month.

### Donations
I have conflicted opinions about crypto myself, but it's available as an option if you find it most convenient.

* litecoin: ltc1qusqdxatldzkwe9dn2cr255ffrcuxz85wh4kcdf
* monero: 43JchZMdLEsiLj5TMPbV72CWzmD3gL9kD5rA42T1WoabMayde75vvKg7uRBC8nFgjNGoLm1eHoQMWdFX7dJ9mR8W1BGAuzU

If you don't got crypto, consider contributing to [my wishlist](https://throne.com/gigirassy) so I can have more money left to pay for the services. It helps a ton as me and my family have virtually no income at the moment, and it's anonymous as well. Costs for my services total to around 15 USD a month. [You can also buy me books from Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/wishlists/61ca8d380887896314d43867300b67839f0ef315) if you'd like.
