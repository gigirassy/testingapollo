#### What does Autigender mean?

That autism influences how I see my nonbinary gender. It's a pretty recent label coined by the Autistic community, but it's not a new concept.

#### What hobbies do you have?

A lot. I do archival, draw, be the world's cutest anarchist, take funny pictures of my toys, take those toys on adventures, share current events commentary, and more. I also garden.

#### What does your (online) name mean?

It's the Lenape verb for a baby nursing. Picked it to be cutesy while fitting with my cultural heritage back in mid-2021 and never looked back.

#### What the heck is a Gigirassy?

Long ago as a 12 year old in 2018, I went by the name "ggrassy" on social media, naming myself after a character, "Grassy" from the animated web series Battle for Dream Island. I eventually abandoned that persona. Then in 2020, I decided to come back to main social media under a previously-abandoned account named by that on FANDOM. Then, it became Gigirassy, because I had previously called myself Gigi after the first two letters in that name. I don't go by Gigi anymore. However, the alias "Gigirassy" served as an artifact I had wanted to keep. Until now. I hate that name now.

#### Why do you like Blitzwing so much?

I just think he's a neat funny guy and I relate to him. We're both brainfunky, speak in funky ways, and have frequent mood swings. Animated Blitzwing is not the only incarnation of him I appreciate.

#### Ok, so you're an anarchist. What's your specific political ideology?

Anarchism with abolitionist and bootlegging/shadow archival-supporting priorities. Books are fun. ([1](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/mirror/a/ay/angela-y-davis-are-prisons-obsolete.pdf) / [2](https://cdn.nakamotoinstitute.org/docs/against-intellectual-monopoly.pdf))

#### Why are you weird?

Being a cool weirdo is an act of bravery.

#### Can I have a link to your anarchist/revolutionary ebook archive?

Sure, shoot me a message at my email.

#### Are you employed?

Nope. My family has absolutely no income other than government and cashback money.

#### Where is the nearest exit?

Ideally below.
