Maybe-Asked Questions
---------------------

Stuff you may or may not want to ask me about, but I'm going to answer anyways.

If it's not answered here, feel free to contact me through Instagram/Email/Discord.

#### Why do you use neopronouns? Why don't you just use they/them?

That's a common question I receive. A general reason why people might use neopronouns is because he, she, or they doesn't sit right with them personally, which is my case. Another reason, belonging often to the funkier ones, is because trans people might want to express their interests. Many neopronoun sets are older than you think, not that new ones being coined is an issue. My main neopronoun set dates to the 70s.

If you don't understand how to use someone's neopronouns, they'll generally be happy to explain and you'll get used to it with practice!

Ey/em is used exactly like singular they/them without the th. That shouldn't be too hard to figure out.

Lun/luns is a nounself pronoun set. Most, but not all nounself pronoun sets, are used by replacing the it in it/its with the noun. This kind of pronoun set dates to the 1800s at least, with thon/thons.

#### What does Autigender mean?

That autism influences how I see my nonbinary gender. It's a pretty recent label coined by the Autistic community, but it's not a new concept.

#### Other than your pronouns, what can I call you?

Solely call me Nune, and avoid explictly gendered terms aside from stuff like "guy". Also, don't refer to me as human, I'm pretty confident I'm a Cybertronian therian ([wink](/theriotype)). The term "person" is okay! Don't know what the heck I feel like yet. But honestly, the details are another story for close friends and probably not your business.

#### What is your site built on?

Zola, with a slightly modified version of the Apollo theme. I changed the fonts, colors, and added the TFW2005 icon. Also disabled Mathjax, because honestly why the hell do I need 2 MB added to a 52~ KB web page for something I won't use?

#### What hobbies do you have?

A lot. I do archival, draw, be the world's cutest anarchist, take funny pictures of my toys, take those toys on adventures, share current events commentary, and more. I also garden.

#### What does your (online) name mean?

It's the Lenape verb for a baby nursing. Picked it to be cutesy while fitting with my cultural heritage back in mid-2021 and never looked back.

#### What the heck is a Gigirassy?

Long ago as a 12 year old in 2018, I went by the name "ggrassy" on social media, naming myself after a character, "Grassy" from the animated web series Battle for Dream Island. I eventually abandoned that persona. Then in 2020, I decided to come back to main social media under a previously-abandoned account named by that on FANDOM. Then, it became Gigirassy, because I had previously called myself Gigi after the first two letters in that name. I don't go by Gigi anymore. However, the alias "Gigirassy" served as an artifact I had wanted to keep. Until now. I hate that name now.

#### Why do you like Blitzwing so much?

I just think he's a neat funny guy and I relate to him. We're both brainfunky, speak in funky ways, and have frequent mood swings. Animated Blitzwing is not the only incarnation of him I appreciate.

#### Ok, so you're an anarchist. What's your specific political ideology?

Anarchism with abolitionist and bootlegging/shadow archival-supporting priorities. Books are fun. ([1](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/mirror/a/ay/angela-y-davis-are-prisons-obsolete.pdf) / [2](https://cdn.nakamotoinstitute.org/docs/against-intellectual-monopoly.pdf))

#### Why are you weird?

Being a cool weirdo is an act of bravery.

#### Can I have a link to your anarchist/revolutionary ebook archive?

Sure, shoot me a message at my email.

#### Are you employed?

Nope. My family has absolutely no income other than government and cashback money.

#### Where is the nearest exit?

Ideally below.
