## Nune's tech specs

This is a list of current devices I own.

### Main PC: Dell Inspiron 3650
> Originally, I had bought this to use as a server as a Linux noob. Turns out my ISP has a prohibitive policy on self-hosting, so I use a VPS instead. VPSes are way more reliable, anyways. After a failed Arch install, I left it alone. However, I eventually remembered about this PC one day and decided to change it to my daily driver, installing ~~Linux Mint~~ ~~Fedora~~ ~~tri-boot NixOS, CachyOS, Fedora~~ ~~Arch~~ Fedora on it. It's specced out for storage space, useful for [REDACTED BY THE OFFICE OF SENTINEL MAGNUS] and just general stuff.
* Intel© Core™ i5-6400 CPU @ 2.70GHz × 4
* 16GB RAM, 8GB Swap, 1TB~ HDD
* OS is Fedora
* Monitors are DEL4032 and AL1916W.

### New Phone: OnePlus 5
> This phone runs vanilla LineageOS and I don't use it much, but it is used as an alarm, to take pics, and the like.
> 6GB RAM

### Former Phone: ZTE Avid 4
> This used to be my Grandma's. Then I had to factory reset it so it could be handed down to my sister. It was so, so full of viruses before. Then, my little sister got it and barely used it. Then, she passed it to me. The phone is slow, crashes upon downloading items from Firefox, and is overall not the best time. Not only that, but I tried to uninstall Google Play Services and replace that with MicroG; but whoever set up this phone has it locked in. I will be getting myself a phone that's actually good, and which preferably has LineageOS preinstalled.
> Update: See above.
* Hand-me-down
* Degoogled as much as possible, demetro'd, and deFacebooked via ADB.
* 2GB RAM

### Laptop 1: Dell Latitude 5400
> After getting a similar laptop from eBay that failed for some unholy reason after a month, I had got this as the replacement. It works very amazingly, although it pretty much has noob specs. It used to have Windows 10 on it, but after I had abandoned Windows due to my growing disdain for corporations, I installed Manjaro and then Fedora on it. It now dualboots Fedora and NixOS Works like a charm, no regrets.
* Intel© Core™ i5-8365 CPU @ 1.60GHz x 8
* OS is Dualboot Fedora Linux/NixOS (formerly Manjaro, and  Windows 10!)
* Broken Q, CTRL, and W keys
* 16GB RAM, 256GB space

### Laptop 2: Toshiba Satellite A135-S442 [pic](/toshibalaptop.png)
> I'm amazed this thing is still alive. It's literally older than Transformers Animated. I saw this bad boy on eBay and was able to get it for just 25 bucks shipped. It has lines on the screen, but amazingly all of the keys are intact. It does not have a CD drive anymore.
* Intel® Core™ Duo Processor T2250
* OS is BunsenLabs Linux, will be switched to Void or OpenSUSE when 32-bit support is officially ended for Debian.
* 32-bit
* 3GB RAM, 2GB swap, and 160 GB space

### Laptop 3: Lenovo Thinkpad x131e (AMD)
> Bought for 30 bucks from a business, this is a ThinkPad with the soul of a netbook. Having less than 4GB RAM and 2 dinky cores, it's actually not too bad depending on what you're using it for. It's a cute little potato.
> OS is Alpine Linux.

### Raspberry Pi 4
> 4GB ram variant, in storage.

Devices I'd like to own are below:
* ARM64 Chromebook
