## Nune's tech specs

This is a list of current devices I own.

### Main PC: Dell Inspiron 3650 [pic](/dellpc.png)
> Originally, I had bought this to use as a server as a Linux noob. Turns out my ISP has a prohibitive policy on self-hosting, so I use a VPS instead. VPSes are way more reliable, anyways. After a failed Arch install, I left it alone. However, I eventually remembered about this PC one day and decided to change it to my daily driver, installing ~~Linux Mint~~ Fedora on it. It's specced out for storage space, useful for [REDACTED BY THE OFFICE OF SENTINEL MAGNUS] and just general stuff.
* Intel© Core™ i5-6400 CPU @ 2.70GHz × 4
* 8GB RAM, 8GB Swap, 1TB~ HDD
* OS is Fedora XFCE Spin (formerly Linux Mint)
* Monitor is Acer AL1916W, black (that's right, it's a 16-year-old monitor!)
#### VMs
* Void Linux from scratch, about 18 GB storage space, one core and 2 GB of RAM. It has very minimal software added by me. Great coding exercise! ([pic](/dellpcvoid.png))

### Phone: ZTE Avid 4 [pic](/ztephone.png)
> This used to be my Grandma's. Then I had to factory reset it so it could be handed down to my sister. It was so, so full of viruses before. Then, my little sister got it and barely used it. Then, she passed it to me. The phone is slow, crashes upon downloading items from Firefox, and is overall not the best time. Not only that, but I tried to uninstall Google Play Services and replace that with MicroG; but whoever set up this phone has it locked in. I will be getting myself a phone that's actually good, and which preferably has LineageOS preinstalled.
* Hand-me-down
* Degoogled as much as possible, demetro'd, and deFacebooked via ADB.
* 2GB RAM

### Laptop 1: Dell Latitude 5400 [pic](/delllaptop.png)
> After getting a similar laptop from eBay that failed for some unholy reason after a month, I had got this as the replacement. It works very amazingly, although it pretty much has noob specs. It used to have Windows 10 on it, but after I had abandoned Windows due to my growing disdain for corporations, I installed Manjaro on it. Works like a charm, no regrets.
* Intel© Core™ i5-8365 CPU @ 1.60GHz x 8
* OS is Manjaro Linux with KDE Plasma environment (formerly Windows 10!)
* Broken Q, CTRL, and W keys
* 8GB RAM, 256GB space

### Laptop 2: Toshiba Satellite A135-S442 [pic](/toshibalaptop.png)
> I'm amazed this thing is still alive. It's literally older than Transformers Animated. I saw this bad boy on eBay and was able to get it for just 25 bucks shipped. It has lines on the screen, but amazingly all of the keys are intact. It does not have a CD drive anymore.
* Intel® Core™ Duo Processor T2250
* OS is AntiX Linux with default IceWM environment. Installed by me!
* 32-bit
* 3GB RAM, 2GB swap, and 160 GB space

Devices I'd like to own are below:
* LineageOS phone with at least 8GB RAM
* Any old laptop with Windows XP/Vista on it, for some fun debugging; seeing what I can do with it!
* A Lenovo Thinkpad with decent specs
