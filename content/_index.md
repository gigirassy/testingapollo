<span style="float:left;padding:5px;">![blitzwing image](/funnyguy.png)</span> Hello. I am Nune (*nu-neh*). I'm a 19 y/o neurospicy-flavored Transformers Animated fanatic who thinks Blitzwing is neat and loves anarchy. [I use ey/em and lun/luns pronouns](https://blitzw.in/maq/#why-do-you-use-neopronouns-why-don-t-you-just-use-they-them). I'm also Autigender.

In my free time, I take funny pictures of my toys, advocate against lawns, do archival, have unhinged convos with my closest friend, and talk/debate about funny robots on TFW2005. [I also occasionally leak those toys when I'm lucky](https://www.tfw2005.com/boards/threads/transformers-collaborative-naruto-shippuden-kurama-gamakichi-anime-toys-tra-gen-project-tails.1268943/).

I am simultaneously the most legally insane and sane person on the internet at once.

**What you're probably here for are my services like my SearXNG and Breezewiki instances! You can see them via the Services portion of the navbar.**

The most reliable way to contact me is through Discord or Instagram DMs, both of which are located under the @blitzw.in usernames. If you don't use these sites due to privacy reasons, you can contact me through a personal email (not my main one) at nune[.at.]imap[.dot.]fi. All emails with that address are signed with [PGP](/PGP.txt).
