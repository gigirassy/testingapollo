<span style="float:left;padding:5px;">![blitzwing image](/funnyguy.png)</span> Hello. I am Nune (*nu-neh*). I'm a 20 y/o neurospicy-flavored Transformers Animated Blitzwing fanatic and anarchist. [I use ey/em and lun/luns pronouns](https://blitzw.in/maq/#why-do-you-use-neopronouns-why-don-t-you-just-use-they-them). I'm also Autigender![autigender flag icon](/Autigendersmall.png), 100% acearo, and most likely a Cybertronian therian. Being human is weird. If you got a problem with my identity, go yell at a CEO instead, it's a more valuable use of your time.

In my free time, I take funny pictures of my toys, advocate against lawns, do archival, have unhinged convos with my closest friend, and talk/debate about funny robots on TFW2005. I have taken over in the place of JTPrime17 for revealing a lot of future Transformers listings for the time being.

I am simultaneously the most legally insane and sane person on the internet at once.

If you're in the United States, I recommend doing something on this <a href="https://blitzw.in/SomeActions">list of actions other than protesting or voting</a> by Mariame Kaba and sharing with your friends.

**What you're probably here for are my services like my Redlib and Breezewiki instances! You can see them via the Services portion of the navbar.**
