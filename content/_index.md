<span style="float:left;">![blitzwing image](/funnyguy.png)</span> Hello. I am Nune (*nu-neh*). I'm a 19 y/o neurospicy-flavored Transformers Animated fanatic who thinks Blitzwing is neat and loves anarchy. I use ey/em pronouns (and trying out lun/luns as a secondary), which work exactly like singular they without the th. I'm also Autigender.

In my free time, I take funny pictures of my toys, advocate against lawns, do archival, have unhinged convos with my closest friend, and talk/debate about funny robots on TFW2005.

The most reliable way to contact me is through Discord or Instagram DMs, both of which are located under the @blitzw.in usernames. If you don't use these services due to privacy reasons, you can contact me through a personal email (not my main one) at nune[.at.]imap[.dot.]fi. All emails with that address are signed with PGP. 

There's a handy navbar at the top now! Browse it for more info.
