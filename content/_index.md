<span style="float:left;padding:5px;">![blitzwing image](/funnyguy.png)</span> Hello. I am Nune (*nu-neh*). I'm a 19 y/o neurospicy-flavored Transformers Animated fanatic who thinks Blitzwing is neat and loves anarchy. [I use ey/em and lun/luns pronouns](https://blitzw.in/maq/#why-do-you-use-neopronouns-why-don-t-you-just-use-they-them). I'm also Autigender![autigender flag icon](/Autigendersmall.png), 100% acearo, and most likely a Cybertronian therian. Being human is weird. If you got a problem with my identity, go yell at a CEO instead, it's a more valuable use of your time.

In my free time, I take funny pictures of my toys, advocate against lawns, do archival, have unhinged convos with my closest friend, and talk/debate about funny robots on TFW2005. [I also occasionally leak those toys when I'm lucky](https://www.tfw2005.com/boards/threads/transformers-collaborative-naruto-shippuden-kurama-gamakichi-anime-toys-tra-gen-project-tails.1268943/).

I am simultaneously the most legally insane and sane person on the internet at once.

**What you're probably here for are my services like my SearXNG and Breezewiki instances! You can see them via the Services portion of the navbar.**

| ### I like:<br>* Transformers (mainly Animated and G1)<br>* Blitzwing!<br>* obscure knockoffs of Transformers toys, esp of Animated<br>* hosting services on my site!<br>* media preservation by any means necessary<br>* Absolute anarchy.<br>* gardening!<br>* attempting to write fanfic<br>* Consolas, my favorite font<br>* Responsible "AI"/machine learning (As in, not-for-profit, ethical models. I think AI should be used to benefit sentient folks, not replace them!) | ### I dislike:<br>* the state<br>* politicians (including "lesser evil"-style rhetoric), cops, prisons<br>* Transformers humanizations (I won't attack, but I suggest you don't show them around me)<br>* ABA and the special "education"/segregation system (as a survivor)<br>* Ableists, eugenicists, and their supporters<br>* People who deny the scientific fact that fiction affects reality or refuse to be critical of what they consume<br>* Negative confrontations<br>* Object shows (These aren't just a dislike, they're a trigger. If you don't know what these are, don't worry about it. If you do, do not bring them up around me.)<br>* Lewd/NSFW content due to trauma<br>* Only a minor dislike but I'm not really a fan of Blackarachnia.|

## Contact

The most reliable way to contact me is through Discord or Instagram DMs, both of which are located under the @blitzw.in usernames. If you don't use these sites due to privacy reasons, I also offer XMPP (which can basically be described as "email if it was Discord"): [handle is nune@ari.lt](xmpp:nune@ari.lt) . It's the most convenient way to contact, as I always got the client up on my main PC.

You can contact me through a personal email (not my main one) at nune[.at.]imap[.dot.]fi. All emails with that address are signed with [PGP](/PGP.txt) unless you elect to not do so on your end. **note: my key recently changed.**
