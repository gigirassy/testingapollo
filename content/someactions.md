**Some Actions That Are Not Protesting or Voting**

*A list adapted from & inspired by [Frontline Medics](https://linktr.ee/frontlinemedics?fbclid=IwY2xjawGgwVpleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHcA4kgYrCxBLeUdo7642MY8KoH7QsClkGosryu_8Gu6zZJFA6mA_xIbuBA_aem_dWcWYhCX8250bZm3yiWzWA)*. Here was their [original list of 25 actions](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCR_78Ry6d4/?img_index=6). I’ve added a lot of things and edited other things. \[**Note**: I continue to update this document as more ideas are shared with me (most recent update 7/14/25). If there are things you want to add, email [niapoetry@gmail.com](mailto:niapoetry@gmail.com) & I can consider them.\]. I have been getting a lot of edit access requests. Everyone is free to make a copy of this doc on your own. I am not giving edit access to the form. Thank you. 

Thanks to Nikki [here is a REFORMATTED VERSION](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m60DyvxQRbbgNoD9WI_gUCBgkPTwW_HvVQWpa-hJz_I/edit?usp=sharing) of this resource. The reformat makes it easier to find information. \[this is not regularly updated\]

\*\*I created \[with input from other organizers\] an interactive workbook for new activists who want to create their own organizing plans. You can download it for free [here](https://millionexperiments.com/zines/making-a-plan). I hope it helps those who need some guidance to focus on specific things you can do in your communities.
